                        <p>Hi. I go by Railgun, dcheung0720, and davidcheung on all platforms. I mainly use email for formal communications but I also use Slack or Discord if I am working with a team. Unfortunately at this time, I do not have a Linkedin or Twitter account. </p>
                        <h2>How to Reach me</h2>
                        <p>You can find me @dcheung0720 on
                             <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/"> Github</a>
                             , @Railgun#7910 on <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>, or simply <a href="mailto:davidcheung2023@u.northwestern.edu">shoot me an email</a>  
                         </p>
                         <h3>Why Railgun? and what's with those whacky numbers in the back (Github)?</h3>
                         <p> I have my username as Railgun because I was intrigued with electromagnetism when I was learning high school physics. Railgun is a weapon "that uses electromagnetic force to launch high velocity projectiles." I thought this concept was cool so I kept using this name. And of course, I TOTALLY wasn't basing my username off of this
                             <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Certain_Scientific_Railgun">Railgun</a> :). (The truth is left as an exercise for the reader)
                         </p>
                         <p> Why those whacky numbers? It's supposed to be an important birthday that I always forget!</p>
