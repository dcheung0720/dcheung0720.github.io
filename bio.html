                            <p>Born in Chicago, raised in Hong Kong, I am David Cheung, a first-generation senior studying Computer Science in McCormick. I am currently enrolled in the BS/MS program and am expected to graduate in Spring of 2023. I am interested in making new innovative software using machine learning to enhance people's everyday lives. More specifically, I want to create and use smart recommendation systems, smart augmentation for human processes, and smart behaviorial prediction systems. </p>
                            <p><b>Personal Interests:</b></p>
                            <p>I like to bike and play video games in my free time (sadly there aren't any nowadays). The games I play include League of Legends, Genshin Impact, and card games.</p>
                            <p> The current learning goals I have are to get more hands on experience with machine learning, particularly in different kinds of neural networks. I also want to learn how to use Flask so I can bridge UI and a database together. Finally, I want to brush up on my linear algebra and calculus so I can be prepared for Advanced Computer Vision that I am going to take next quarter. </p>
