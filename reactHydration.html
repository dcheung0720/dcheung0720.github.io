                        <p> This is a React app with Firebase backend support created by my team and I to help people keep track of their water hydration intake. Everyone can just login using their Google account and start using it right away.  This app is supposed to be a mobile app so the CSS on a web page may not display properly. </p>

                            <p> This is the homepage of the application once you log in. As you can see, there is a progress bar near the top indicating how much you have drank today compared to your daily goal. You can keep track of how much you drank by clicking on the "add" button. If you misclicked, you can simply click the subtraction sign. If a drink you drank is not listed on this page, you can add the drink item to the page by clicking "add item"</p>
